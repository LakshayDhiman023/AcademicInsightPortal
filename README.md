Academic-Insight-Portal
This institute-level management website facilitates interactions for three primary user roles: Students, Teachers, and Admins.

Students can view their profile, check attendance records, access academic results, and stay informed about upcoming events.

Teachers can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) attendance records and student results, as well as post new announcements.

Admins have full access and control over the system, enabling them to manage teacher and student accounts and oversee all other institute-related details.
