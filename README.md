# Academic-Insight-Portal
  

This code sample implements an institute-level management website, facilitating interactions for three primary user roles: Students, Teachers, and Admins.

  

Students: The website allows students to view their profile, check attendance records, access their academic results, and stay informed about upcoming events.

  

Teachers: Teachers can use the platform to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) attendance records and student results, as well as post new announcements.

  

Admins: Admins have full access and control over the system, enabling them to manage teacher and student accounts, and oversee all other institute-related details.
